# calorie-app

Calorie-app is a social media/calorie tracking app. Some notable features include data visualizations using Chart.js and image uploads using Cloudinary. Calorie-app users can create an account and add daily calorie intake and their daily weight. The "Home" of the app serves as a Question and Answer section where members can create posts about questions they may have while other users can comment and give advice.

## How It's Made:

On the front end, I used EJS and TailwindCSS, and on the back end,  I used Node and express. 

For storage, I used MongoDB and Mongoose.

For authentication, I went with Passport.js and local strategy.

I also used a few packages like Method-Override to allow us to use HTTP verbs such as PUT and DELETE in places where the client does not support them. 


**Tech used:** Node.js, Express.js, HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, EJS, MongoDB, Cloudinary, Chart.js

## Optimizations

Features and changes to come:

1. I want to add a "like" functionality to posts
2. Adding nested comments to show replies to comments
3.Friending

## Lessons Learned:

Calorie-app was a fun project that made me realize how much I enjoy Full stack development.

Using TailwindCSS in this project showed me how powerful tailwind can be. While it can make HTML a little cluttered, I see the time savings of being able to style while writing HTML at the same time quickly. Not to mention other things that TailwindCSS offers that I am excited to explore in the future!

I have plans to convert this project to React! Converting this from EJS to React could offer some fun learning opportunities.
